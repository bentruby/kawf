Stuff TODO

-: noone actively working on this right now
W: work in progress by NN

Must be done
============

! user		tag	description
- ------------- ------- -----------
W jerdfelt	PEAR	Use PEAR DB.php for DB routines
W jerdfelt	PEAR	Use PEAR Config.php for config routines
W jerdfelt	PEAR	Abstracted selectable interfaces
-			Better HTML parsing
			Cleanup API
			Replace/Add options
			Dynamic target replacement (ie always _top for this user, always _new for another one)
-			Move posts between forums
-			Merge re-post code into edit somehow
-			Rate limit posts (via f_duppost)
-			Ignore user fearure
W jerdfelt		Finish pid to pmid conversion
-			Restrictions on screen names (prevent @audiworld.com, or moderator, etc)
-			Set return address on follow up emails to followup, or perhaps post reply?

Nice to be done
===============

Use PEAR HTML/ITX.php for templates
Pictureposter width/height auto fill (ties into previous HTML parsing cleanup)
Swear word censoring (replace them with partial or full *'s, etc)
Count number of edits and track last edit for displaying to users
Better tracking (don't use timestamp, use individual mid's)

Possibilities
=============

Use PEAR Cache.php for anonymous users
Use PEAR Mail.php instead of mailfrom
Use PEAR Image/Remote.php to grab width/height info for remote pictures
Use PEAR Benchmark stuff to test out the software
Use X-Forwarded-For header for more IP information
Redesign message and thread database layout (too messy now)
