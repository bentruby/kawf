Stuff TODO $id$

-: noone actively working on this right now
W: work in progress by NN

Must be done
W jerdfelt	PEAR	Use PEAR for DB routines
			Fix funky wrapper scripts. Use PEAR's Config.php as an example
W jerdfelt	INTERFACE Abstracted selectable interfaces
-		Better HTML parsing
		Cleanup API
		Replace/Add options
		Dynamic target replacement (ie always _top for this user, always _new for another one)
-		Move posts between forums
-		Merge re-post code into edit somehow

Nice to be done
Use PEAR for template routines (HTML/ITX.php)
Use PEAR for config routines (Config.php)
Pictureposter width/height auto fill (ties into previous HTML parsing cleanup)
Swear word censoring (replace them with partial or full *'s, etc)
Count number of edits and track last edit for displaying to users
Better tracking (don't use timestamp, use individual mid's)

Possibilities
Use X-Forwarded-For header for more IP information?
Redesign message and thread database layout (too messy now)
