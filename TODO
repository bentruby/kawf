Stuff TODO $id$

-: noone actively working on this right now
W: work in progress by NN

Must be done
W jerdfelt	PEAR	Use PEAR for DB routines
			Fix funky wrapper scripts. Use PEAR's Config.php as an example
W jerdfelt	INTERFACE Abstracted selectable interfaces
-		Better HTML parsing
		Cleanup API
		Replace/Add options
		Dynamic target replacement (ie always _top for this user, always _new for another one)
-		Move posts between forums
-		Merge re-post code into edit somehow

Nice to be done
Use PEAR HTML/ITX.php for templates
Use PEAR Config.php for config routines
Pictureposter width/height auto fill (ties into previous HTML parsing cleanup)
Swear word censoring (replace them with partial or full *'s, etc)
Count number of edits and track last edit for displaying to users
Better tracking (don't use timestamp, use individual mid's)

Possibilities
Use PEAR Cache.php for anonymous users
Use PEAR Mail.php instead of mailfrom
Use X-Forwarded-For header for more IP information?
Redesign message and thread database layout (too messy now)
